    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>
    Ian Chan is a Hong Kong-born Canadian composer whose work integrates and
    synthesizes his diverse interests in contemporary classical music, jazz,
    and musical theatre. Ian's compositions have been performed across Canada
    and the United States by ensembles including the
    <a href="http://www.hrcm.org/">Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum</a>,
    <a href="https://www.sneakpeekorchestra.com/"> Sneak Peek Orchestra</a>,
    <a href="https://www.eporchestra.ca/">Etobicoke Philharmonic Orchestra</a>,
    and <a href="https://www.spo.ca/">Scarborough Philharmonic Orchestra</a>,
    the latter two of which named him their 2017 Promising Young Composer and
    2018 Emerging Young Composer, respectively. Ian's work has been widely
    sponsored at Harvard University, where he has written for the Harvard
    Choruses New Music Initiative, the Office of the Arts, and the Department of
    Music, as well as for collaborations with the
    <a href="https://bostonconservatory.berklee.edu/">Boston Conservatory</a> at
    Berklee College of Music. Ian has studied with
    <a href="https://www.kevinlaumusic.com/main.php">Kevin Lau</a>, and has
    been mentored by <a href="http://robertkyr.com/Home.html">Robert Kyr</a>,
    <a href="http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~chatzis/">Christos Hatzis</a>,
    <a href="http://www.music.hku.hk/hy_chan.html">Hing-Yan Chan</a>, and
    <a href="http://www.ronaldroyer.com/">Ronald Royer</a>. A list of Ian's
    compositions can be found <a href="#comp">below</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
    Beyond composition, Ian's musical interests are widespread. As a conductor,
    Ian has experience leading orchestras, pit orchestras, wind ensembles, and
    choirs; in the 2020-2021 season he will be serving as conductor of the
    <a href="https://americanrepertorytheater.org/">American Repertory Theater</a>'s
    Family Show and the <a href="http://harvardcollegeopera.com/">
    Harvard College Opera</a>'s assistant music director and chorusmaster. As
    a vocalist, Ian sings regularly with the <a href="www.dins.com">Din
    and Tonics</a>, a semi-professional jazz a cappella group, and his choir,
    the <a href="http://www.hrcm.org/">Harvard-Radcliffe Collegium Musicum</a>.
    Ian's instrumental work has awarded him First Prize at the Canadian Music
    Competition in piano and Associate Diplomas from the Royal Conservatory of
    Music in both piano and violin. Recordings of Ian's work as a conductor,
    singer, pianist, violinist, and percussionist are available on request.
    </p>
    <p>
    Ian firmly believes in music as both a bridge between communities and a
    creator of community. He is fascinated by the world's musical potential,
    and strives continually to explore and develop artistic representations of
    global themes, ideas, and stories. Ian loves collaborating with fellow
    creators to produce and inspire exciting, new art.
